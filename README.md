 Project Overview This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether users will accept coupons based on driving scenarios and user attributes. By analyzing factors such as destination, time, weather, passengers, and coupon details, the model helps optimize coupon distribution strategies, enhancing user engagement on e-commerce platforms.

ðŸ“Š Dataset The dataset contains various attributes: User Attributes â†’ Age, occupation, income, etc. Driving Scenarios â†’ Destination, time, weather, passengers. Coupon Features â†’ Type, discount percentage, validity. Contextual Factors â†’ Past coupon usage, user behavior. Target Variable â†’ Accepted_Coupon (Yes/No).

ðŸš€ Project Workflow Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Understanding distributions, correlations, and insights. Feature Engineering â€“ Selecting the most relevant features for better performance. Model Training â€“ Testing various classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.). Hyperparameter Tuning â€“ Using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV to optimize models. Evaluation â€“ Analyzing accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores.

ðŸ“Œ Results & Insights Feature Importance Analysis helps identify key factors influencing coupon acceptance. Model Performance Comparisons provide insights into the most effective algorithms. Business Impact: Helps e-commerce platforms personalize coupon distribution and boost engagement.
